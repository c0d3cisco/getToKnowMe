        <p id="header-p"> Hello, my name is Francisco, but I go by Cisco. I was born in Venezuela in 1990. My mom, sister, and I moved to Knoxville, TN when I was in the fifth grade. I went to school there until I joined the army. In the army, I was a combat medic. I returned to Knoxville after four years in the army to get a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. After graduating, I found a job as a process engineer in a biomedical tech company. They build a software that helps surgeons plan shoulder replacement surgeries (other joints in the future). Through this job, I became inspired to become a software developer and thus here I am. My favorite color is yellow.</p>
